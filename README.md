RESTPie3 - Python REST API Server Starter Kit
=============================================

This is a lightweight REST API server implemented in Python3 offering
essential web service features in a simple package. This is not a framework,
just a practical and clean codebase that relies on few core components that do
the job well. Fork and create your own REST API server quickly.

Open sourced on Sep 2018 after years of production use at multiple sites.

Building blocks
---------------

The core building blocks of this server are mature open-source components that
I have years of experience of.

* [Python](http://python.org) is a high-level and versatile scripting language
  that provides powerful features with an exceptionally clear syntax.

  The language is well designed and has received increased fame and
  popularity over the recent years. Huge number of developers are picking
  Python in their work. In Sep 2017, a StackOverflow study writes about [The Incredible
  Growth of Python](https://stackoverflow.blog/2017/09/06/incredible-growth-python/):
  "Python has a solid claim to being the fastest-growing major programming
  language." In the [TIOBE index](http://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/)
  Python stands at position 3 as of Sep 2018.

  Having been coding Python professionally for close to two decades, I can say
  it has boosted my productivity and still is my primary language for many
  tasks, including developing the business logic in the back-end.

* [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) is the Python web framework. Flask is
  considered as an unopinionated micro-framework that only provides the
  essentials of a web framework without enforcing other components (like
  database, orm, admin interface, sessions etc.) As a webdev veteran I
  appreciate this flexibility since I do want to pick the best of breed
  components myself. The core stays but other needs may vary from project to
  project, from Raspberry to the AWS cloud. The flexibility lets me be in
  control and simplify.

* [uwsgi](https://uwsgi-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) is the master daemon
  that runs and supervises the Python worker processes. uwsgi has a list of
  power features that are essential to a robust back-end: timecapped requests,
  recycling of workers, background tasks, cron jobs, timers, logging, auto
  reloads on code change, run-as privileges.

* [PostgreSQL](http://postgresql.org) is the main database, "the most advanced
  open source database" that is getting stronger every year. PostgreSQL is a
  powerhouse of features with a rock-solid implementation. Personally I enjoy
  the JSON functionality the most, since it provides good amount of
  flexibility to the relational model that I still prefer in a master database
  over the schema-free solutions.

* [Redis](https://redis.io/) is a persistent in-memory database that is used
  as a storage for server-side session data and as a lightweight caching and
  queueing system. Fast and solid.

* [Peewee](http://docs.peewee-orm.com/en/latest/) is a straightforward
  database ORM library.  It is small and easy to learn, and has all the
  necessary features.  I favor the simplicity of the ActiveRecord pattern with
  1-1 mapping of classes and database, as opposed to more complex data mapper
  pattern that is followed by the big
  [SQLAlchemy](https://www.sqlalchemy.org/) library. I know SQL and like to
  operate at the row level, and have explicit control.
  Peewee makes database access a breeze and allows you to execute raw
  SQL if you need the full power of the database. Peewee supports SQLite,
  MySQL and PostgreSQL.

  For scheme migrations,
  [Peewee-migrate](https://github.com/klen/peewee_migrate) is an easy choice
  that fits well with Peewee.


If you'd like to replace some of these components, it is possible, this is a
small codebase.


What about the front-end?
-------------------------

This is primarily a back-end Python server that provides a REST API to the
world. There is no front-end implementation in this project. This is because
the focus is on creating a good REST API server that serves web front-ends and
native mobile apps, but also because I think that it is good to modularize the
front-end and back-end code cleanly into separate code bases.

A web front-end in 2018 can be a big project with gazillion of Javascript
libraries and tools. It is better to clearly separate the front and back parts
from each other.  This can also make it easier to divide the work among
in-house/outsourced teams.

However, nothing stops you from implementing the front-end in this server
project if you want to have all the code in a single place. And if you only
need a few server generated HTML pages, you can take a look of included
[example.html](templates/example.html).

If you want inspiration of how to develop a modern web front-end that consumes
a REST API, take a look of my two open-source starter kits:

* [React/Nextjs starter](https://github.com/tomimick/tm-nextjs-starter)
* [Vue/Nuxtjs starter](https://github.com/tomimick/tm-nuxtjs-starter)

React and Vue are currently the most popular Javascript frameworks to create
front-ends, followed by Angular which is a bit heavier, suited for bigger
bisness apps.

The two front-end starters and this server handle movie data as an example. You
can connect the front-ends to this server but first you need to allow
visitor access for the API methods in `api_movies.py` as the front-ends do not
implement a login.

```

So how do you get started with your own project? I suggest to take this route:

* browse briefly the source files, understand their role
* read and throw away `002_movies.py` and `api_movies.py`, they exist only as
  a sample
* discard `cron.py, bgtasks.py` if you don't need background processing
* discard `templates` if you only create an API server
* write your own business logic:
  * create data classes and methods in `db.py or db_x.py`
  * create API modules in `api_x.py`
  * create database migrations
  * create tests


Run locally with Docker
-----------------------

The fastest and easiest way to test drive RESTPie3 on your machine is to use
[Docker](https://www.docker.com/). The server fully supports Docker - the
Docker image is created with this [Dockerfile](Dockerfile).

The base image is an [official python image](https://hub.docker.com/_/python)
variant **python:3.7-slim-buster**, a recent and small Debian as of
August 2019. The generated image size is 216MB, 76MB gzipped.

If you already have Docker installed, the quick steps to run RESTPie3 plus its
services Redis, PostgreSQL are:

    # download latest redis version 5.x
    docker pull redis:5

    # create + start the redis instance
    docker run -d --name redis -p 63790:6379 redis:5

    # download latest postgresql version 11.x
    docker pull postgres:11

    # create + start a postgres instance - use your own db + password!
    # the params here must match the ones in conf/server-config.json
    docker run -d --name pos-restpie -p 54320:5432 -e POSTGRES_DB=tmdb -e POSTGRES_USER=tm -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=MY_PASSWORD postgres:11

    # activate the uuid extension
    docker exec -it pos-restpie psql -U tm -d tmdb -c 'create extension "uuid-ossp"'

    # build the RESTPie3 image
    git clone https://github.com/tomimick/restpie3
    cd restpie3
    docker build -t restpie-image:0.0.1 .

    #ON WINDOWS or MAC USE THIS TO create + start RESTPie3
    docker run --name restpie -d -p 8100:80 restpie-image:0.0.1
    
    #ON LINUX USE THIS (tested for Ubuntu 18.04 LTS) with latest docker
    docker run --name restpie --add-host=host.docker.internal:$(ip route | grep docker0 | awk '{print $9}') -d -p 8100:80 restpie-image:0.0.1
     
    # create initial database schema in postgresql
    docker exec -it restpie bash -l -c 'python /app/scripts/dbmigrate.py'


If all went OK, RESTPie3 + Redis + PostgreSQL are running and you should be
able to list the REST API at http://localhost:8100/api/list

The database is empty at this point so empty lists are returned from the API.
You are also logged out so some of the API end-points can't be accessed. To
quickly test the API, you can invoke this example script which uses curl to do
a signup and insert a new movie in the database:

    ./test/quick.sh

Note that I am using custom ports for Redis (63790) and PostgreSQL (54320), so
that they are not mixed with official service ports and so that I can run
multiple simultaneous instances at different ports, if necessary.

To start and stop these docker instances, invoke:

    docker start redis
    docker start pos-restpie
    docker start restpie
    docker stop redis
    docker stop pos-restpie
    docker stop restpie

If you don't want to use docker, you can install Redis, PostgreSQL, python3
and the required python libs on your local machine too. On OSX,
[Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) is a good installation tool. These steps are not
documented here, but it's not that hard.


Develop locally with Docker
---------------------------

Docker is great for packaging software to be run in the cloud, but it is also
beneficial while developing the software. With Docker you can isolate and play
easily with different dev environments and services without installing
anything on the local machine and without facing ugly local version conflicts.
Running the same docker image locally also ensures the environment is
identical to the release environment, which makes a lot of sense.

Here's how to run the same RESTPie3 image in dev mode:

    # build a dev image
    docker build --build-arg BUILDMODE=debug-docker -t restpie-dev-image .

    # run the dev image - write your own local path here!
    docker run -it --rm --name restpie-dev -p 8100:80 -v ~/Downloads/restpie3/py:/app/pylocal restpie-dev-image

    # or alias for the above docker run
    ./run.sh

Then you should see the REST API list again at http://localhost:8100/api/list
but this time in DEV mode: IS_LOCAL_DEV=True.

The above command runs the dev instance in the foreground so you are able to
see the logging output in the console and detect errors immediately. You can
stop the server with CTRL+C.  When the instance ends, its data is deleted (the
--rm option) - this is good as we don't want to create a long list of dangling
temporary instances.

Now the COOL thing in the dev mode here is that we are using Docker volumes to
map a local `py` folder containing the python source files to `pylocal` folder
inside the Docker instance. This makes it possible to use any local file
editor to edit the python sources and when a file is saved, the server inside
the Docker instance reloads itself automatically!

To see the executed SQL statements of the server in the console, you can set
the PYSRV_LOG_SQL env variable:

    docker run --rm --name restpie-dev -p 8100:80 -v ~/Downloads/restpie3/py:/app/pylocal -e PYSRV_LOG_SQL=1 restpie-dev-image


If you want to run a shell inside the dev instance, invoke in another terminal
session, while dev instance is running:

    docker exec -it restpie-dev bash -l

    # or just
    ./shell.sh

    # see files in the instance file system
    ls
    ll

    # see running processes
    htop

    # run python files
    python scripts/something.py

You can modify the [login script](conf/loginscript.sh) to set paths and
aliases etc for this interactive shell.


API methods
-----------

The available API methods are implemented in api_x.py modules:

* `api_account.py` contains the core email/password login/signup/logout
  methods that you most likely need anyway.
* `api_dev.py` contains misc methods for testing and developing which you can
  discard after learning the mechanics.
* `api_movies.py` is just a sample module to demonstrate a basic CRUD REST
  API.  You definately want to discard this and transform into your actual
  data models - just read and learn it.

The server has built-in little [introspection](#screenshot) for listing the available APIs as
a HTML page.  You just declare, implement and document the API methods
normally with the Flask decorator, docstrings and the methods will be
automatically listed at
[localhost:8100/api/list](http://localhost:8100/api/list). This is a neat way
to document your server API. You can decide whether you want to disable this
functionality in production or not.

To parse and serialize JSON data I am simply using the Flask and Peewee
primitives: `jsonify, JSONEncoder and Peewee
model_to_dict/dict_to_model`. I am not using other libraries such as
[Flask-RestPlus](https://flask-restplus.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) or
[Connexion](https://github.com/zalando/connexion). I have used
[Flask-Restful](https://flask-restful.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) before but I
am not sure these libs add value. You might be able to reduce the number
of code lines a little with them but possibly loosing simplicity and control.
In my opinion Flask already provides the core I need. Adding one of these libs
is perfectly possible though should you want it.

Also I am not using [Swagger](https://swagger.io/) here but I do have felt the
temptation! The first question with Swagger would be which way to go: To first
create the API spec manually and then generate the method stubs, or first
write the methods with annotations and then generate the API spec? I am not
sure about the order and [neither is the community](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=14035936).  Swagger maybe good for big projects but this is a
small and cute project :)


Authentication & authorization
------------------------------

Simple email-password based signup and login authentication is included in the
server. It relies on [PassLib](https://passlib.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)
Python library for strong uptodate hashing algorithms.

A Python decorator called `login_required` can be inserted before an API
method that controls that the method requires an authenticated user session,
and optionally to specify if the method requires a certain user level. User
accounts have a role-field whose value is one of:

```python
    user.role = (disabled, readonly, editor, admin, superuser)
```

You can set the user roles that are meaningful for your project, see the
migration [001_users.py](migrations/001_users.py). If this simple linear role
model is too limited, you can introduce a capability model perhaps with a text
array field, similar to `user.tags`.

For example, this method requires that the user is logged on and has a role
editor:

```python
    @app.route('/api/movies/', methods = ['POST'])
    @login_required(role='editor')
    def movie_create():
        """Creates a movie and returns it."""
        #...code here...
```

If the user does not have an editor role or above, the API server returns 401
Unauthorized to the client.

API methods which don't have a `login_required` decorator attached are
available for anybody, including non authenticated visitors.

Accounts with role=disabled are stopped at the door and not let in to the
server at all.

If you want to support Facebook or Google OAuth authentication method, I
recommend you use the [rauth](https://github.com/litl/rauth) library.

By default the server allows accessing the API from all domains, CORS
`Access-Control-Allow-Origin value='*'` but it can be set in the config file.


Session data
------------

Server-side session data is stored in Redis. Data written into a session is
not visible at the client side.

Flask provides a thread-global session object that acts like a dictionary. You
set keys to values in the session. A value can be any object that can be
[pickled](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pickle.html). Modifications to the
session data are automatically saved to Redis by Flask at the end of the
request.

This starter stores two core data in the session: `userid` and `role` of the
user. (Role-field is in session for performance reason: otherwise we would
need to query it from the database with EVERY request that specifies
login_required. Note that if the user role changes, you need to update it in
session too.)

A common operation in an API method is to access the calling user object,
myself.  There is a call `webutil.get_myself()` that loads myself from the
database, or None for a visitor.

Flask also provides a thread-global object called `g` where you can store
data, but this data is *only stored for the duration of the request.* This
data is not stored in Redis and is discarded when the request ends. `g` can be
used for caching common data during the request, but don't overuse it.

Redis is a persistent storage, unlike memcached, which means that if the
server gets rebooted, the user sessions will be restored and logged-in users
do not need to relogin.

By default, the session is remembered for 1 month. If there is no user
activity during 1 month, the session gets deleted. This time is controlled by
PERMANENT_SESSION_LIFETIME in [config.py](py/config.py).


Redis storage
-------------

You can also use Redis for other than session data. Redis can act as a
convenient schema-free storage for various kinds of data, perhaps for
temporary data, or for lists whose size can be limited, or act as a
distributed cache within a cluster of servers.

A typical case might be that a background worker puts the calculation results
into Redis where the data is picked from by an API method (if the result is
secondary in nature and does not belong to the master database).

The module [red.py](py/red.py) provides simple methods for using Redis:

```python
    # store a value into Redis (here value is a dict but can be anything)
    value = {"type":"cat", "name":"Sophia"}
    red.set_keyval("mykey", value)

    # get a value
    value = red.get_keyval("mykey")

    # store a value that will expire/disappear after 70 minutes:
    red.set_keyval("cron_calculation_cache", value, 70*60)
```

To append data into a list:

```python
    # append item into a list
    item = {"action":"resize", "url":"https://example.org/a.jpg"}
    red.list_append("mylist", item)

    # take first item from a list
    item = red.list_pop("mylist")

    # append item into a FIFO list with a max size of 100
    # (discards the oldest items first)
    red.list_append("mylist", data_item, 100)
```

red.py can be extended to cover more functionality that
[Redis provides](https://redis.io/commands).


Background workers & cron
-------------------------

uwsgi provides a simple mechanism to run long running tasks in background
worker processes.

In any Python module (like in [bgtasks.py](py/bgtasks.py)) you have this code:

```python
    @spool(pass_arguments=True)
    def send_email(*args, **kwargs):
        """A background worker that is executed by spooling arguments to it."""
        #...code here...
```

You start the above method in a background worker process like this:

```python
    bgtasks.send_email.spool(email="tomi@tomicloud.com",
            subject="Hello world!", template="welcome.html")
```

The number of background worker processes is controlled by `spooler-processes`
configuration in [uwsgi.ini](conf/uwsgi.ini). The spooled data is written and
read into a temp file on disk, not in Redis.

Crons are useful for running background tasks in specified times, like in
every hour or every night. uwsgi has an easy built-in support for crons. To
have a nightly task you simple code:

```python
    @cron(0,2,-1,-1,-1)
    #(minute, hour, day, month, weekday) - in server local time
    def daily(num):
        """Runs every night at 2:00AM."""
        #...code here...
```


Logging
-------

Logging is an essential tool in monitoring and troubleshooting the server
operation. This server automatically logs several useful data in the log file,
including the request path, method and parameters, and return codes and
tracebacks. Userid and origin ip address is logged too.

Secrets should not be written into a log file to prevent unnecessary leakage
of data.  Currently this server automatically prevents logging keys
["password", "passwd", "pwd"] if they exist in the input parameters of an API
method. You should extend this list to cover your secret keys.

In local development, the log is dumped to the console, and at server the log
is dumped to a file `/app/app.log`. It is also possible to send the logging
output to a remote `rsyslog`. This can be useful in a cluster setup.

Slow queries that take more than 1 second to finish are logged with a warning
SLOW! and the log line includes the actual amount of time it took to respond.
It is good to monitor where the pressure starts to cumulate in a server and
then optimize the code or put the execution into a background worker.

Requests that take more than 20 seconds get terminated and the following line
is logged: `HARAKIRI ON WORKER 1 (pid: 47704, try: 1)`. This harakiri time is
configurable.

To log the executed SQL statements during development, see PYSRV_LOG_SQL
above.

Note that as the server logs may contain sensitive data, you should not keep
the production logs for too long time, and you should mention in the policy
statement what data you collect. The GDPR legislation in Europe has a saying
on this.

To monitor the log file in realtime at server you can invoke:

    tail -f -n 500 /app/app.log

To see the logged errors only, in most recent first order:

    tac /app/app.log | grep "^ERR " | less -r

This starter comes with a simple log line colorizer out of the box, hilighting
warnings and errors with a simple logging.Formatter. This is convenient but
the escape codes are inserted into the log file. If you want to have a more
powerful logging colorizer, take a look of
[grc](https://github.com/garabik/grc) for example.

As an example, the server logs [this output](test/sample.log.txt) when the
included API tests are run.


Tests
-----

The test folder contains two test scripts for testing the server API and the
Redis module. Keeping tests up-todate and running them frequently or
automatically during the process is a safety net that protects you from
mistakes and bugs.  With dynamic languages such as Python or Javascript or
Ruby, tests are even more important than with compiled languages.

For locally run tests I expose a method `/apitest/dbtruncate` in
[api_dev.py](py/api_dev.py) that truncates the data in the database tables
before running the API tests. If you like to write tests in a different way,
just remove it.

Run tests inside the DEV instance:

    docker exec -it restpie-dev bash -l -c 'python /app/test/test_api.py'
    docker exec -it restpie-dev bash -l -c 'python /app/test/test_redis.py'


Deploy to Linux server running Docker
-------------------------------------

To be written. Docker compose, rsync+reload script etc.


Deploy to VPS
-------------

Even though the world is crazy about Docker, I still often like to deploy code
directly and quickly to VPS servers, especially during project start and early
development. Setting up the components and the environment at server requires
some initial effort but you then have absolute control and visibility to
the whole server. Not every project needs a big cluster first.

Setting up a whole cluster at [AWS ECS](https://aws.amazon.com/ecs/) is no
easy feat, you need to learn and configure A LOT.
[Dokku](http://dokku.viewdocs.io/dokku/) seems nice but has limitations,
allowing to run only a single Docker image. I wish the container/Kubernetes industry still matures more and provides a
[Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/)-like effortless deployments of Docker
images.

So if you have plain VPS servers, and want to have super speedy updates from
localhost to the servers, I have created a single Python script
[fabfile.py](fabfile.py) that automates the deployment. It relies on [Fabric tool](http://www.fabfile.org/) that rsyncs the source code securely over SSH.

The deployment is activated just with:

    fab deploy

This transfers only the changed source files from localhost to a server,
performs database migrations and restarts the Python server. All in just
4 seconds. This makes the core dev/test loop really fast.

In any case, this is just an optional script. If you have a big environment,
you most likely have a Continous Integration / Deployment solution in place.


Setup VPS server
----------------

Here are rough steps about how to setup a VPS server for this Python server.
This is not a tutorial, I assume you know Linux and SSH basics.

During the development of this project I used latest Ubuntu 18.04 myself.
These steps should work for Ubuntu. Steps will vary depending on your OS and
version. Python3.x comes pre-installed in recent Ubuntus.

Install PostgreSQL and Redis at server:

    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install redis-server
    sudo apt-get install postgresql
    sudo apt-get install python3-pip
    sudo apt-get install rsync (on Debian)
    mkdir /app/

Redis does not require more setup. For PostgreSQL, create the database and
the user: (pick your own names and secrets for the capital parts!)

    sudo su - postgres
    createuser MY_USER
    createdb -O tm MY_DATABASE
    psql MY_DATABASE
    alter user MY_USER with encrypted password 'MY_PASSWORD';
    create extension if not exists "uuid-ossp";

Write the IP-address or server name locally in your fabfile.py as
TEST_SERVER. Plus add your SSH credentials and a path to your public key.
Then transfer source files to the server, and install the
[systemd daemon](conf/pydaemon.service):

    # locally
    fab deploy
    fab deploy_mydaemon

Install Python libraries:

    sudo pip3 install -r /app/requirements.txt

Edit the json config file at server, write PostgreSQL credentials:

    cd /app/
    cp conf/server-config.json real-server-config.json
    pico /app/real-server-config.json

And finally re-deploy: (does database migration, server restart)

    # locally
    fab deploy

For a production setup you must also configure uwsgi to run as a lower
privileged user and not as a root! Check the [uwsgi guide](https://uwsgi-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).


Nginx
-----

Few words about Nginx: if you want to run this API server and your front-end
under the same domain, and you are using Nginx, you can have the following
Nginx config to send all /api/ requests to Python server and other requests to
other destinations, like to Node and file system:


        # in nginx config:

        # to python api server
        location /api/ {
            uwsgi_pass localhost:8010;
            include uwsgi_params;
            uwsgi_param  X-Real-IP  $remote_addr;
            uwsgi_param  X-Real-Host $host;
        }

        # static files
        location /static/ {
            root /path/to/myfiles;
            # note that you must have /path/to/myfiles/static/ folder,
            # unless rewriting the url
            try_files $uri /index.html =404;
        }

        # to Node server
        location / {
            proxy_pass http://localhost:8080;
            proxy_http_version 1.1;
            proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
            proxy_set_header Connection 'upgrade';
            proxy_set_header Host $host;
            proxy_cache_bypass $http_upgrade;
        }


And then enable the uwsgi-listener in [uwsgi.ini](conf/uwsgi.ini):

        # in uwsgi.ini:
        [uwsgi-production]
        uwsgi-socket = localhost:8010


Security
--------

A few words about security practices in this software:

* no secrets are stored in code but in an external configuration file or in
  environment variables
* all requests are logged and can be inspected later
* no secrets are leaked to the log file
* server based sessions with an opaque uuid cookie
* no Javascript access to uuid cookie
* config to require https for cookies (do enable in production)
* strong algorithms are used for password auth
* only salt and password hash is stored in the database
* session can be either permanent or end on browser close
* sensitive user objects have a random uuid and not an integer id
* possible to add a fresh cookie check by saving IP+agent string to session
* database code is not vulnerable to SQL injections
* authorization is enforced via user roles and function decorator, not
  requiring complex code
* uwsgi supports running code as a lower privileged user
* uwsgi supports SSL certificates (but a load balancer or nginx in front is
  recommended as SSL endpoint)

Of course the overall security of the service is also heavily dependent on the
configuration of the server infrastructure and access policies.


Scaling up
----------

While the codebase of this server is small, it has decent muscle. The
*stateless* design makes it perfectly possible to scale it up to work in a
bigger environment. There is nothing in the code that "does not scale". The
smallness and flexibility of the software makes it actually easier to scale,
allowing easier switch of components in case that is needed. For
example, you can start with the uwsgi provided background tasks framework and
replace that later on with, say [Celery](http://www.celeryproject.org/), if
you see it scales and fits better.

In a traditional setup you first scale up vertically, you "buy a bigger
server".  This code contains a few measures that helps scaling up
vertically:

* you can add worker processes to match the single server capacity
* you can add more background processes if there is a lot of background jobs
* slow requests are logged so you see when they start to cumulate
* stuck requests never halt the whole server - stuck workers are killed after
  20 seconds by default, freeing resources to other workers (harakiri)
* you can optimize SQL, write raw queries, let the database do work better
* you can cache data in Redis

When you outgrow the biggest single server, and start adding servers, you
scale horizontally. The core API server component can be cloned into a cluster
of servers where each of them operates independently of the others. Scaling
the API server here is easy, it is the other factors that become harder, like
database scaling and infra management.


Need help?
----------

This starter is intended to provide you a quick start in building a great
foundation for an API back-end. Take this code and see if it works for you.
This server is not a toy - it is a practical, solid server that is based on my
experience in building full-stack services over the years.
